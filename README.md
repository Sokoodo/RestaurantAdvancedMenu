# RestaurantAdvancedMenu
 Knowledge Engineering Project 

## Description
With COVID-19 many restaurants have their menus digitized. Guests can scan a QR code
and have the menu presented on their smartphones. A disadvantage is that the screen is
very small and it is difficult to get an overview, in particular, if the menu is large. However,
some guests can not or do not want every meal, e.g. vegetarians or guests with an allergy.
Instead of showing all the meals that are offered, it would be preferable to show only those
meals the guest prefers.
The objective of the project is to represent the knowledge about meals and guest
preferences and create a system that allows to select those meals that fit the guest
preferences.
The knowledge base shall contain information about typical meals of an Italian restaurant,
e.g. pizza, pasta, and main dishes.
Meals consist of ingredients. There are different types of ingredients like meat, vegetables,
fruits, or dairy. For each ingredient, there is information about the calories.
Guests can be carnivores, vegetarians, calorie-conscious, or suffer from allergies, e.g.
lactose or gluten intolerance.
## Task
Create different knowledge-based solutions based on
- Decision tables
- Prolog
- Knowledge graph
and create a graphical modeling language, which allows a chef to represent meals with their
ingredients in a graphical way.
Write a brief explanation of each solution and a conclusion chapter that explains the
advantages and disadvantages of the three knowledge-based solutions.
